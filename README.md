Hello there!

So this was originally "ThePrayerApp" which I was using android studio which was using Dart to make my app. But I am now restarting to use React Native since it is cross-platform. I know it's all part of the learning process so bear with me. It will get done!

The idea behind this app is to help Muslims keep not only theirselves but their friends accountable for praying 5 times a day. In order to do that, I wanted to make a group chat type service that allows you to anonymously nudge someone who hasn't marked that they've prayed before the time is up.

I amn now usin React Native to work on the front-end design and I will use Firebase for the back-end stuf. I'm hoping to get this on both iOS, Android and Windows eventually

Stay tuned! I'm pretty excited about this project! :)
